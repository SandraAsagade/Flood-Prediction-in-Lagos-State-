# Predicting the Next Flood Date in the City of Lagos,Â Nigeria (Stage2-HNG11-Data-Analytics-Internship)

## Introduction
Flooding is a recurrent and significant challenge in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, disrupting daily life, and posing severe risks to public health and safety. Understanding and predicting flood events are crucial for effective disaster preparedness and mitigation. This case study aims to forecast the likely date of the next flood in Lagos. By analyzing historical weather patterns, precipitation levels, tidal data, and other relevant factors, we seek to develop a predictive model that can provide timely warnings and help in planning preventative measures. This study not only highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in addressing environmental challenges but also aims to contribute to the resilience and sustainability of urban environments prone to flooding.

## Methodology
In this case study, data-driven approach was employed to predict the next potential flood date in Lagos. the first step was collecting extensive historical data on weather patterns. This data was then cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. Further analysis was conducted to identify patterns and correlations between rainfall intensity, and duration. A predictive model was developed using logistic regression, incorporating key variables such as average precipitation per hour and total rainfall duration. The model was trained and validated to ensure its reliability in forecasting flood events. Finally, the predictions were analyzed to identify the most probable date for the next flood, highlighting areas at risk and the factors contributing to the heightened flood likelihood.
